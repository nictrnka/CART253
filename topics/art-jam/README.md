## Description

You can't seem to get to sleep... try counting sheep! 
Infinite sheep are trying and get past a fence, 
And you have to time your mouse click on the sheep and make it jump over the fence.
  
If the sheep hits the fence you are jolted awake and the game is restarted,
But if it makes it past, the sheep count increases.
 
The amount of sheep that you have successfully counted makes you sleepier and sleepier,
So the scene slowly gets darker with each sheep.
