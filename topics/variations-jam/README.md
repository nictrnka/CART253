## Description

 A Brick Breaker type game based on musical modes & a synthesizer.
 There are three levels / modes to choose from, each with a color palette and pre-determined musical mode.
 Bricks spawn in a random pattern on a grid & each time the ball bounces it plays a random synth note from the mode.
